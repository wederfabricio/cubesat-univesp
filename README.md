## Resume

This work aims to demonstrate how nanosatellites development can contribute to the
development of the acquired knowledge during the computer engineering graduation, taking as an
example the development of electrical power. Technical requirements for Electric Power Systems
development for nanosatellites such as mission planning, component specification, forecast and
budget of energy to be made available and expected efficiency during its operation are strategic
points in CubeSat projects and directly aligned with concepts taught in the disciplines of the
computer engineering course, so that its use as a theme in integrating activities and projects can
contribute positively to the training of students, under technical and citizenship perspectives.
Considering that the next years, 2022 to 2032, will be marked by a new space race, with plans to
take the first woman and the next man to the Moon and also the potential arrival of the first human
on Mars, it is opportune to imagine that the use of this theme to encourage the study of the practical application of concepts studied throughout the course can contribute to the training of students and the preparation of future professionals, whether by helping them to visualize work prospects in this segment or in the management and development of complex projects in the most diverse areas.
